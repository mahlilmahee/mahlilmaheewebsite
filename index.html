<h2>WHAT IS DREAM?</h2>  
<P> Let define what is dream. Dream is not the thing you see while sleeping rather than it is something which doesnot allow you to sleep until its finished.Dream is like drug the more you will think about it , the more you will get attach to it.Dream needs hardwork , determination , thinking and action to fulfill .Once it is fulfill than the world will be more meaningful for you. The world is totally on your thinking .If you think world is bad , it is bad. If you think it is easy , the word is as easy as drinking a glass of water.</P>
